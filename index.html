				<h2>About Me</h2>

				

				<div class="bio-content">
					<img id="aboutMeImage" src="assets/images/profile-image_v2.jpg" alt="Profile Image">
					<p> My name is Leo and I reside in Kearney, MO.  I have a passion for utilizing technology to help businesses run more efficiently.  This is what I try to do at KC Store Fixtures, where I am Netsuite Administrator and VP of Information Technology.  Netsuite is a cloud-based ERP system and I have had great success in customizing it to match our business processes (or vice versa in some cases).  To accomplish these improvements I have used: SuiteScript (built on JavaScript), PHP, SQL, and Web Services.  I like to do the problem-solving and process re-engineering without any specific technology in mind, then go figure out the best solution.  </p>

					<p>In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my 1 year old son (Leo V!) and wife, playing and watching sports, video games, reading biographies, watching documentaries, and playing pool.  Favorite TV show is The Wire and I have fully watched the series LOST more than once.  Favorite hobby in the world - Ultimate Frisbee.  
					</p>

					<p>I am a proud alum of the University of Missouri, where I graduated with a BS in Industrial Engineering and MBA.</p>
